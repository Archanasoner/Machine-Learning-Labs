This is a Repository which contains different types of algorithms which we use in Machine Learning. The above mentioned datasets are the one swhich we use for a particular algorithm. So I am mentioning the algorithms for reference:
1. Student Evaluation dataset --- Linear Regression
2. Housing Price dataset --- Linear Regression
3. Cancer Dataset ---- Logistic Regression
